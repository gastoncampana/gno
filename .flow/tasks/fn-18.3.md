# fn-18.3 WebUI: frontmatter date sort options

## Description
WebUI: expose frontmatter-based sorting options when present in a collection.

Scope:
- Detect date-like frontmatter fields during indexing (reuse metadata extraction).
- For a collection with >=1 date field, expose sort choices in UI (e.g., Newest by <field>, Oldest by <field>).
- Use stored doc_date per field for sorting (no client-side parse).
- Fallback to file modified if field missing on doc.
- Keep non-date fields out of sort menu.
## Acceptance
- collection exposes available frontmatter date fields via API
- UI shows sort options only when date fields exist for current collection
- selecting frontmatter sort orders results by that field desc/asc, fallback to modified date
- no parsing in UI; uses server-provided sort
- tests cover at least 2 date fields across docs in same collection
